# 🌌 Astrophotography Image Catalog System

## 📘 Project Overview

Astrophotographers often share their work on social media platforms like Instagram or Facebook. However, these platforms are not designed to store or showcase the complete imaging dataset required for serious astrophotography workflows—such as light, dark, flat, and dark flat frames. Furthermore, they lack support for metadata management, session tracking, and post-processing collaboration.

The **Astrophotography Image Catalog System** solves this by providing a centralized, open-source platform specifically tailored for astrophotographers. It supports storing, organizing, and sharing all imaging files with rich metadata and session-based management, empowering both the uploader and the wider community to learn, experiment, and collaborate.

## 🎯 Key Features

### 📂 Complete File Upload Support

* Upload all types of astrophotography data:

  * **Light Frames**
  * **Dark Frames**
  * **Flat Frames**
  * **Dark Flat Frames**
  * **Bias Frames** (optional)
* Organize files per celestial object or imaging session.

### 🛰 Metadata Management

* Extract and display detailed metadata:

  * Camera model
  * Lens/telescope details
  * Mount, filter, guiding equipment
  * Exposure time, ISO/gain, temperature
  * Location and date/time of capture

### 🗓 Session Management

* Group multiple imaging targets under a single **session**.
* Useful for tracking an entire night's worth of data across objects.
* Attach notes or session-level equipment details.

### 🌠 Celestial Object Tracking

* Users can log the celestial object being imaged (e.g., M31, NGC 7000).
* Attach multiple object entries to one session.

### 🧪 Collaboration & Processing

* Other users can download raw frames for post-processing.
* Showcase alternative processing results and share techniques.

### 👤 User Management

* Sign-up/login functionality
* User profiles with location, gear, and image history
* Optional private/public sharing of images

### 🌐 Deployment Options

* **Self-hosted:** Run your own instance for complete control.
* **Hosted platform:** Use the maintained cloud version (with tiered pricing options for storage and collaboration).
